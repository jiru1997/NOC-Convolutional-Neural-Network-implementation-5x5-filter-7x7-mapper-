# NOC-Convolutional-Neural-Network-implementation-5x5-filter-7x7-mapper-
NOC Convolutional Neural Network implementation by using systemverilog

In this project, we built four CNNs to take the knowledge we learned from classes and papers 
into practice. Based on the modules we built for homeworks, we implemented the basic network 
by which we can fetch data from a .txt file, perform convolution calculations, compare the final 
result with the golden result and report the errors. We also achieved some enhancements like 2D 
PEs arrays, convolutional layers and data pooling. By doing this project, we learned the basic 
calculation mechanism of machine learning, and enhanced our skills of using SystemVerilog and 
teamwork. 

In this part, the input filter is a 5x5 matrix and input mapper is a 7x7 matrix.

You can use QuestaSim to build and run this project.
